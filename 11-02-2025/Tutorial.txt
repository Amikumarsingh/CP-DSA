This Java solution generates the nth element of the Count and Say sequence iteratively. It starts with "1" and builds each subsequent sequence by analyzing and encoding the previous one. The loop runs (n-1) times, updating current at each step. A StringBuilder efficiently constructs the new sequence by counting consecutive identical characters and appending <count><character>. The process continues until the nth sequence is generated, which is then returned. This approach ensures a structured and optimized way to compute the count-and-say sequence
