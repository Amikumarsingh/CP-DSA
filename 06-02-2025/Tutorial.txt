The given Java class Solution implements the maxProfit method, which finds the maximum profit that can be obtained from buying and selling a stock once, given an array of stock prices. It initializes max_profit to 0 and min_so_far to the first price. As it iterates through the prices, it updates min_so_far to track the lowest price seen so far and calculates the profit by subtracting min_so_far from the current price. The maximum profit is updated accordingly. Finally, it returns the highest possible profit. This approach runs in O(n) time complexity as it processes the array in a single pass.
