//explanation:-
   
// This program determines whether a string can be turned into a palindrome by modifying at most one character.
//   A palindrome is a string that reads the same forward and backward. To check this, the program compares characters 
//   from both ends of the string, moving inward toward the center. It counts the number of mismatched character pairsâ€”where 
//   the character at position i from the start does not match the character at position i from the end.If there is exactly one
//   mismatch, it is possible to make the string a palindrome by changing one of the mismatched characters, so the output is "YES." 
//   If there are no mismatches, the string is already a palindrome. For strings with an odd length, the middle character can still
//   be freely changed, and the output is "YES." However, for even-length strings with no mismatches, no changes are allowed while 
// preserving the palindrome property, so the output is "NO." If there are more than one mismatch,
//   it is impossible to make the string a palindrome with a single modification, resulting in "NO."
 
//   For example, the string "abca" has one mismatch between 'b' and 'c,' so it can be turned into a palindrome by changing either
//   of these characters, and the output is "YES." The string "racecar" has no mismatches, so it is already a palindrome, and the output
//   is "YES." However,the string "abcd" has two mismatches, so it cannot be made into a palindrome with a single change, and the output is "NO."
