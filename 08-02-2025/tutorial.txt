Intuition
If we thought that all elements of the vector is a number we need to increase it by 1. 
The input can be 100 digits so we must handle that through digits.

Approach
First we increment the first digit (last element) by 1, if it becomes 10 we make it 0 ans add 1 to the second digit.. 
until the last digit (first element), if it becoms 10 we make it 1 and push_back a leading zero.
